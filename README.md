# Huddle-landing-page-with-alternating-feature-blocks
This is my solution for Huddle landing page with alternating feature blocks. I would be happy to have comments on the way it has been done. It has been done mainly using HTML and CSS. Please tell me, what could be improved and what has not been done properly ? Thanks !
